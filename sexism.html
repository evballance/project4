            <h4>Religion teaches women to obey their husbands as they would God, that they should not have sexual desires, that they should also practice modesty These women are taught to believe that their sexuality should be hidden which leads to shame in their community. Sexual shaming is harmful, listen to an experience from Kylie, a former evangelical.  ‘For example, we were told that women don’t really think about sex and that served to multiply my shame and it amplified the feeling that I was “not normal.” I had “too much of a sex drive.” We were told that boys were visually stimulated and thought about sex on a near constant basis.” She was told she was not normal but the guys were normal for the same thing. No woman's worth should be based on her sexuality.  The New York Times states some of the oppressive behaviors in Religion, “The New Testament quotes St. Paul  as saying that women “must be silent.” Deuteronomy declares that if a woman does not bleed on her wedding night, “the men of her town shall stone her to death.” An Orthodox Jewish prayer thanks God, “who hast not made me a woman.” The Koran stipulates that a woman shall inherit less than a man, and that a woman’s testimony counts for half a man’s.”
There is also the problem of religion not giving women their own choices on what to do with their bodies. This is a problem with telling them what to wear and abortion. It is not anybody's choice but the woman, to decide if she wants to have a baby or not. It is also not anyone's choice on a woman's clothing. A certain church even wants to ban contraceptives saying it's their religious freedom to try and do that.
