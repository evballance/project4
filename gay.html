They protest in public areas with signs that say gays should die and that god hates them. Children and actual members of the community can see these derogatory signs and internalize them. </h4>

            <h4>These churches do not only protest they go as far as trying to convert LGBT people
conversion therapies are very harmful therapies usually inside a church that uses their own methods to try and turn people straight. Some methods that they use are putting blocks of ice on a person's hands while showing them pictures of two men holding hands. They would also put coils on their hands that could be cold or hot. When showing the person a straight couple the coils would be cold but if it was a guy and a guy hugging they would burn their hands. The conversion camps would even go as far as sticking needles into their hand while showing the victims explicit pictures of men and shocking them. This would fear condition them to be afraid of men holding hands, it would not turn them straight.  This is just harming their mental and physical health. The human rights campaign stated that conversion therapy leads to an increased chance of depression, anxiety, suicide, drug use, and homelessness. Even though this is cruel treatment only five US states have outlawed it.  </h4>
