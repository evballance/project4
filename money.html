            <h4>Tithe, giving your earnings to support a church. Other known as a “duty” to God or a form of worship. David Lee shares his story about his tithing experience. "It was pandemonium. They weren't just giving money, but shoes, watches and diamond rings," Lee says. "There were people dropping alligator shoes on the altar...They bypassed their common sense..One lady took off her wedding ring and dropped it of on the altar. That's how charged the atmosphere was. People got caught up."  Pastors get caught up with this money, one pastor in Atlanta even asked his church to buy him a private jet. Some pastors and church leaders make the members of that church pay 10% of their income. If you are devoted to God and someone tells you to give up some of your paycheck for him, how can you say no? Especially if everyone around you is sharing, when a basket is being passed around in plain sight, you are going to feel uncomfortable not putting money in. The people who give the most are publicized as well. Albertson, who used to work in a church talks about this, “the senior pastor invited the biggest givers to stand before the church and explain how their generosity had strengthened their faith..It irritated people in the congregation, they picked people who were able to give a lot of money because they had decent jobs. It seemed like there was a comparison going on: We're going to value the bigger givers more than the smaller givers." On top of this there is not even a passage that says tithing is necessary.
